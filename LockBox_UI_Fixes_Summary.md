# LockBox UI Fixes and Improvements Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ Made About Page Scrollable
- **Problem**: About page content was not scrollable for better content viewing
- **Solution**: 
  - Wrapped content in `QScrollArea` with proper scroll bar styling
  - Added extensive content including Key Features, Technical Specifications, and Contact information
  - Implemented custom scroll bar styling with hover effects
  - Made content responsive and properly organized

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed CSS Property Errors

#### "Unknown property backdrop-filter" Errors
- **Problem**: PyQt6 doesn't support web-specific CSS properties like `backdrop-filter`
- **Solution**: Removed all unsupported CSS properties and replaced with PyQt-compatible alternatives

#### "Unknown property transform" Errors  
- **Problem**: PyQt6 doesn't support CSS `transform` properties
- **Solution**: Removed transform properties and used PyQt-native styling instead

#### CSS Gradient Syntax
- **Problem**: Used web-style `linear-gradient()` syntax
- **Solution**: Replaced with PyQt-compatible `qlineargradient()` syntax
  ```css
  /* Before */
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #141A20, #212A34);
  
  /* After */
  background: qlineargradient(x1:0, y1:0, x2:0, y2:1, 
      stop:0 #141A20, stop:1 #212A34);
  ```

### 3. ‚úÖ Fixed Font Issues
- **Problem**: Application trying to use "Segoe UI" font which doesn't exist on Linux
- **Solution**: 
  - Added cross-platform font stack: `'Ubuntu', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif`
  - Applied consistent font families across all UI components
  - Ensures proper font rendering on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### 4. ‚úÖ Enhanced Send Message with MAC Address Functionality
- **Problem**: User requested MAC address inclusion like "(Macs-MacBook-Air-3.local)"

    - IP Address
    - MAC Address
    - System information
